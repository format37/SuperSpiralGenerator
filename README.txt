Super Spiral Generator Scripts - Created by inHaze

NOTE: Updated and fixed by jonthesquirrel: https://github.com/jonthesquirrel/SuperSpiralGenerator
Original: https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/custom-spiral-generator-worldedit-script/

This is a set of special WorldEdit craftscripts I put together that will allow you to quickly create in game custom spirals and 3d patterns of any size, shape, or material you like.

I created these after playing around with manually building spirals before with the WorldEdit mod and figured there was a more efficient/automatic way of doing it. So I started messing around with some ideas till I came up with this set of three scripts.

Installation/Setup

Singleplayer

1) Install the SinglePlayerCommands mod which comes with WorldEdit.
2) Open your main "%appdata%/.minecraft" folder up. (The one with bin and saves folder)
3) Copy the downloaded, unzipped folder "craftscripts" into it, merging with existing folder if necessary.
4) From the .minecraft folder navigate to the mods folder then to the sppcomands folder.
5) Find the worldedit.properties file and open with any text editor.
6) Go to the line that reads "scripting-timeout=" and change the value to 30000.
7) Save the file and close all folders, open Minecraft and test it out with the command "/cs spiral".

Multiplayer                      *You must own/have access to server files to install scripts.

1) Install WorldEdit plugin on the server.
2) Put the contents of the craftscripts directory in plugins/WorldEdit/craftscripts on the server.


Errors/Troubleshooting

Problem: I can't type at all.
Fix: Singleplayercommands isn't working, trying re installing from a fresh minecraft.jar.

Problem: Error Message "Failed to find an installed script engine." when using script.
Fix: Go here, download the Rhino Zip file. Unzip it and copy the included js.jar to your "/.minecraft/bin" folder.
(http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html)

Problem: Error Message "Script does not exist .../.minecraft/craftscripts/spiral.js" when using script.
Fix: Worldedit can't find the script in the craftscripts folder, make sure you copied it to the "/.minecraft" folder.

Problem: Error Message "Your clipboard is empty. Use //copy first." when using script.
Fix: Just like it says, you need to select and copy a set of blocks first, using the worldedit wand.

If there are other problems you come across make sure to let me know.

(There are some know issues with creating really large spirals, it can be worked around but requires modifying the script. I will likely fix this in a later version.)
